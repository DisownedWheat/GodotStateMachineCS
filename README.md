# Godot Mono State Machine
Simple state machine so I don't have to write it all over again.

To start clone the repository into your `addons` folder (or create it in the root of your project if it doesn't exist). 

There are two different state machines. The basic `StateMachine` is for making a state machine that exists entirely in code, which can be useful.

The other is `NodeStateMachine`, which relies on Godot's node system for handling state.

And you should be ready to go.
